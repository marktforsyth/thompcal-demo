# Thompson Calendar Demo

Here's the demo of my family calendar PWA project, with fake names and birthdays and whatnot.

## Usage

Run on localhost with `yarn start`. The password is `password`.

## Background

My extended family likes to keep a calendar where we put our birthdays and anniversaries, and also quotes (random funny things that people have said throughout the year). Some of my aunts and uncles asked me to make a digital version so people can read through the quotes (and keep track of birthdays), but it also lets you submit quotes for next year, so when we make the next calendar everything will be in one central database.

Let me know if you have any questions!
